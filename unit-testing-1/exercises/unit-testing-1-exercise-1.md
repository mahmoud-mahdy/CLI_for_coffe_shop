# Add Two Numbers

You have been asked to write a python function named `add_two_numbers` with the following requirements:

1. It should receive two numeric arguments and return mathematical addition of them. First initialization of the function would be like this:

```python
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
   pass
```

1. If a non-numeric arg has been passed to the function it should return the string `Invalid Input`
1. It should be robust to all of these scenarios:
   - `adds two whole numbers`
   - `adds a positive whole number to a negative whole number`
   - `adds two floating point numbers`
   - `adds a string to a whole number`
   - `adds two strings`

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
_note: you may find you need to improve your function to cater to all scenarios listed_
