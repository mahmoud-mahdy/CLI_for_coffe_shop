# Project Background

This full End-to-End ETL pipeline was developed for Cafehub chain. The objective was to create a comprehensive data pipeline system designed to streamline and manage orders across multiple branches of coffee shops. when uploading the data to s3 bucket the pipline from there starts as explained in the diagram the data gets processed, clean, normalised and sent to Redshift warehouse additionaly powerful visualization through Grafana to monitor and analyze order is added to the system to show the data from all the branches so it can analysed.

## Final product
The following video shows the final product which is the data shown in graphs on Grafana that is connected to Redshift and shows the pipeline working through adding new data to the pipeline

## Visualisation

In our project, Grafana is implemented for various visualizations aimed at monitoring different aspects.
For a business analyst, this might involve visualizing the top 10 selling products.

On the technical side, we can generate reports to check that infrastructure is performing correctly. So we know if we need to make any changes.
Example. Report whether the instance has passed both the instance status check and the system status check within the last minute.
