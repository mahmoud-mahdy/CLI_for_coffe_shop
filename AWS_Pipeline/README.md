# Project Background

This full End-to-End ETL  ETL pipeline was developed for Cafehub chain. The objective was to create a comprehensive data pipeline system designed to streamline and manage orders across multiple branches of coffee shops. This system gives us the opportunity to receive, process, and store CSV files in the AWS Redshift warehouse, incorporating powerful visualization through Grafana to monitor and analyze order data from various branches. The objective was to create a comprehensive ETL solution using PostgreSQL, Docker, and Python. This system includes features like data extraction, Data Transformation and data loading into AWS Redshift warehouse.


## The technical architecture

## How to run the project:

1. Clone project (repository)
2. Pip install requirements.txt
3. Run formation.yaml
4. Log in to AWS account
5. Set up date for Redshift connection
6. Connect to Grafana
7. Create visualisation and monitor metrics in Garfana.


## Visualisation

In our project, Grafana is implemented for various visualizations aimed at monitoring different aspects.
For a business analyst, this might involve visualizing the top 10 selling products.

On the technical side, we can generate reports to check that infrastructure is performing correctly. So we know if we need to make any changes.
Example. Report whether the instance has passed both the instance status check and the system status check within the last minute.
