# sodoku_solver

The "Sudoku Solver" is a Python script developed as a personal project to enhance my programming skills in Python during my free time. This project focuses on efficiently solving Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

### How to Use:

⦁ Input Puzzle: Define the 'board' variable with the Sudoku puzzle, inserting '0' for empty cells.
  
⦁ Run Solver: Execute the script, triggering the backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.

⦁ View Solution: The completed Sudoku solution is displayed through the 'print_board' function
