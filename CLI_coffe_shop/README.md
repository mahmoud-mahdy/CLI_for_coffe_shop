## Project Background:
The project was done during my boot camp course in generations UK and Ireland.
The CLI Coffee Shop Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage the daily operations of a coffee shop. It offers a user-friendly command-line interface for efficient management of products, couriers, and orders.

# Client requirements:
three menus for products, couriers and orders
a client can add, inspect, edit and remove each of the products list, couriers list and orders list.
data persistence data saved in files or in a database (MySQL).
to use files to save dates please go to branch "week-5" and to use MYSQL database use the main branch and compose up the docker container

# How to run the app
method one: can be run using Python on the command line or any other IDE
method two: can be run using the stand-alone file (..\dist\main\main)
please note that the MYSQL database has to be working you can use the docker file to compose up the database container

# Testing
pytest is used to run unit tests as proof of concept however projects have been tested fully through manual testing.

## Project Reflections
# How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
meet all requirements within the deadline.

# If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
list all orders based on status

# What did you most enjoy implementing?
the logic part of manipulating items in a list
