## Project Background:
This CLI-based application is designed for managing a coffee shop. It streamlines the handling of products, couriers, and orders, providing an efficient system for coffee shop operations.

# Client requirements:
three menus for products, couriers and orders
a client can add, inspect, edit and remove each of the products list, couriers list and orders list.
data persistence data saved in files or in a database (MySQL).
to use files to save dates please go to branch "week-5" and to use MYSQL database use the main branch and compose up the docker container

# How to run the app
method one: can be run using Python on the command line or any other IDE
method two: can be run using the stand-alone file (..\dist\main\main)

# Testing
pytest is used to run unit tests as proof of concept however projects have been tested fully through manual testing.
