## Project:
Machine learning predictive models

## Tasks: 
develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke. The dataset used consisted of 5110 patients with 12 attributes, including age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking status, among others.

## Overview:
Knime software - graphical user interface (GUI) has been used to develop the models therefore no code is provided in the repository. 

⦁	preprocessing of the data such as removing the ID attribute, ignoring the missing,.etc.

⦁	analysing the dataset and identifying the attributes that affect the likelihood of having a stroke.

⦁	several classification algorithms, including random forest, gradient-boosted trees, and probabilistic neural networks, were implemented, and their performance was compared to determine the best algorithm

## Results:
reached a prediction accuracy of 77.8% using the random forest algorithm and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the random forest algorithm in handling the classification problem.
